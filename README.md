## About csasMarPhys

csasMarPhys helps support data analysis to produce data products presented in the research document
that summarizes the meteorological and physical oceanographic conditions on the Scotian shelf and Gulf of Maine, 
[as seen here](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/Publications/ResDocs-DocRech/2018/2018_016-eng.html).

This package mainly has functionality to download and read various data sources around the web.
It also has some basic plotting methods used to produce consistent plots required for the document.
Various files that are critical for various aspects of the analysis also reside in this package to
insure that they are never lost.
